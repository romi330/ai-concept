# Artificial Intelligence Concept Project
With GPT-01's help, I created a GPT for a school project because I wanted to learn how machine learning and artificial intelligence worked. I was fascinated by how AI models process information, generate responses, and improve over time. Building my own GPT allowed me to dive deeper into concepts like natural language processing and model training while gaining hands-on experience. Throughout the project, I experimented with different prompts, fine-tuned responses, and explored the potential applications of AI in various fields. This experience not only expanded my knowledge but also inspired me to continue exploring AI development in the future.
