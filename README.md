## ðŸ§  My AI Journey  

With **GPT-01's** help, I built a custom GPT for a school project to explore **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence** firsthand. I was fascinated by how AI processes information, generates responses, and improves over time.  

### ðŸš€ What I Learned  
- **Natural Language Processing** (NLP)  
- **Model Fine-Tuning & Prompt Engineering**  
- **AI Applications Across Various Fields**  

This project deepened my understanding of AI and inspired me to continue developing smarter and more efficient models. Stay tuned for more innovations!
